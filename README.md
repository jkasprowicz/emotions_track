IMDb Review Analysis with Emotion Inference

Overview

This project performs sentiment and emotion analysis on movie reviews from IMDb. It leverages machine learning models to infer the emotional tone of each review and compares these inferences with the associated star ratings. Visualizations are created to illustrate the relationship between the emotional content of the reviews and their ratings.

Project Structure

Data Collection: Scrapes IMDb review summaries and ratings from specified movie URLs.
Emotion Analysis: Utilizes a pre-trained emotion classification model to infer the emotions present in each review.
Data Visualization: Generates plots to compare and analyze the correlation between emotions and ratings.
Technologies Used

Python: Programming language used for data collection, analysis, and visualization.
Selenium: Tool for web scraping IMDb review summaries and ratings.
Transformers: Hugging Face's library used to perform emotion inference using pre-trained models.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
Matplotlib / Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook / Python Script: Environment used for running the code and generating outputs.
